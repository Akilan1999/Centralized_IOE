## THE AIM
Our aim is to create an energy sharing platform that will be integrated into communities and will consequently result in effective usage of energy which can be sold at a reasonable price depending on demand.   

## Why did we start with the centralized version ?
We will use a simple backend model that can communicate with smart meters at home to control the flow of the electricity. The client-server architecture has a lot of  support and tools available for development. This means we can create functioning platform with a lot of features at a quicker pace.
